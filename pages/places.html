          <p>
            The main place that I go to is Karnataka, in India. Almost all of my
            family lives there (cousins, aunts, uncles), so it can be lonely at
            times in Columbus but going there makes it all better. My mom's side
            lives in a town called Gokarna, which is a coastal village in the
            north of Karnataka. It is extremely religious so all of my uncles
            there are priests. There I had my ceremony called a Munji which is an introduction to Vedic Studies, somewhat accurately described by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/upanayana" class="link" target="_blank">Britannica.</a> It was
            crazy, probably more than 500 people showed up, 90% of whom I didn't know, but it was cool and I got a lot of
            gifts from it. It also helped me connect more with my "extended extended" family there, or even just see them for
            the first time since I was a baby. A lot of the people had only seen me when I was a couple months old, even
            though we go back a lot, so it was nice to meet all of them. There are a few beautiful beaches there, one is
            called Om Beach because it kind of resembles Om (hindu symbol). This
            makes it pretty popular, so a lot of the cash generated is from
            tourists. In fact, it is rated <a

              class="link">one of the best tourist spots in South India. </a>Going there is always relaxing and fun
            because I get to
            spend time with my cousins. They are all younger than me in Gokarna,
            and I have fun especially with the boy, Teju. We have always had a
            lot of fun when we see each other there, besides when we were
            younger because he would scratch me a lot. Sometimes it is a bit
            hard there because I don't speak the language 100% fluent, I can
            understand and get by in most conversations, but nothing too
            in-depth. Also, we have a bit different cultures because here in
            America is a lot different from there. One example is, I am
            left-handed, and once they saw me eating with my left hand and
            laughed. In America no one cares too much, but there it is wrong to
            do that. I was young so I cried, and now I never eat with my
            left-hand. That's just a small example but there are many more.
            My most recent place was Europe, we went on a tour between Amsterdam, Paris, and Zurich. You could really
            appreciate all of the architecture there and it was beautiful. Interesting enough though, I wasn't that big
            of a fan of Paris even if it is the biggest tourist spot; it seemed to be much more of a city where you
            won't have much fun if you aren't deeply
            into fashion or the arts. I much preferred Zurich and seeing the mountains there.
