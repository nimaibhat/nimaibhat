                I attend a high school in the Columbus Metropolitan Region of
                Ohio. I also attend Columbus State Community College
                concurrently just to challenge myself. Outside of school, I am
                in the programming club. In this, we prepare over the year to
                attend an

                >
                near Cleveland. This brings me a lot of excitement as we get to
                compete against high schools around Ohio and maybe learn
                something from them. Also, if you place well you get to earn
                prizes. I'm also a part of our tennis team. I have been playing
                tennis for 10 years probably, taking classes at a few clubs
                around the area and playing with my dad. Our school tennis team
                puts a lot of effort in, and we never miss a practice during the
                season even with bad weather, so it is tough, but I still have
                fun with it. During summertimes we travel a lot to India, as
                that is where almost all of my family lives. Most of them are
                near a city called Bangalore in the Southern part of India. At
                home we speak Havyak-Kannada, which is a dialect of the language
                Kannada used commonly in

Sometimes I feel a bit disconnected from the culture, like in <a href="https://citwebdev.cscc.edu/~nbhat/csci1145/project9/pages/places.html#:~:text=One%20example%20is%2C%20I%20am%20left%2Dhanded%2C%20and%20once%20they%20saw%20me%20eating%20with%20my%20left%20hand%20and%20laughed.%20In%20America%20no%20one%20cares%20too%20much%2C%20but%20there%20it%20is%20wrong%20to%20do%20that.%20I%20was%20young%20so%20I%20cried%2C%20and%20now%20I%20never%20eat%20with%20my%20left%2Dhand." class="link">this story</a>, but when I go to visit
                my cousins and everyone there it feels so nice. I got into
                programming from just having a computer for a long time and I
                gained interest from there. My parents are also in IT but I
                never really see what kind of work they do and I believe it is
                more project management rather than coding. From then, I have
                mostly been learning languages and concepts in the summertime,
                when I am out of school. This has mainly included C++ and Java.
                I enjoy C++ a lot more because you can tinker with some of the
                low level stuff, while also having access to higher level stuff
                like Java. Also the structure just seems a lot better than Java,
                where everything is an object which leads to messy code
                sometimes. I do understand though, that Java has lots of use
                cases in enterprise software which is why it was taught to me in

                >
                aiming to be a better version of it, although I don't see it
                happening until very far down the line, because right now
                basically everything has some C++ behind it.

                I also am trying to learn SQL, which I believe will be especially useful in Oracle-heavy jobs, or even if not that, just to expand my knowledge in computer science. This is occurring in my <a href="https://citwebdev.cscc.edu/~nbhat/csci1145/project9/pages/classes.html#:~:text=Database%20Systems%20Program,incorporates%20Database%20Administration." class="link" target="_blank">Database Systems Programs </a>class, and by myself.
